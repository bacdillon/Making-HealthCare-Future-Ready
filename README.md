# Making-HealthCare-Future-Ready

# Overview
"The senior citizen population in Singapore is going to triple in the next 15 years, and this will have significant implications in terms of how do we provide appropriate healthcare and how do we move people," the Executive Deputy Chairman of GOVTECH, Steve Leonard.

A rapid ageing population in Singapore has increases demand for quality healthcare numerous and varied and places a strain on existing infrastructures. As part of our Smart Nation initiative, to utilize the technology and networks to enhance patient health and fitness access to healthcare and boost productivity in healthcare systems. 
Increasingly, Internet of Things and Big Data opportunity, finding new applications within healthcare and fitness leveraging connected sensors to diagnose and manage patients, treatment and fitness. Mainly focused on clinical-grade wearables to track patient data, to monitor symptoms, collect data and detect patterns in participant data in real time, 24 hours a day, seven days a week while others opportunity for sensor networks within hospitals and practices to optimize healthcare delivery and monitor patient adherence. 

# Solution 

A robust, flexible deployment options on-premise or Cloud and secure platform could be set up using Cloudera Enterprise based on Apache Hadoop for IoT platform solution for data management and analytics built on Apache Hadoop to efficiently capture, store, process and more importantly all the data generated from IoT. The platform would link up data sources from various hospitals, public healthcare institutions, clinics, first responders, intermediary service providers such as telecom and mobile networks, on-line portals as part of e-Government, and patient empowerment through using medical wearable devices, social media information exchanges in between providers and other organizations and even allow individuals to contribute data from self-monitoring devices.
	
# Impact 
Revolutionizing Data for health care
1. By implementing IoT-enabled medical wearable devices, data on a patient’s vital signs and intake of medication can be collected and monitored in real-time. Not only is the safety of care improved, the time and cost required to collect and chart data is greatly reduced. IoT-enabling medical devices can allow nurses to spend more time on direct care and interaction with patients, helping to improve the quality  

2. Health data sets that are so large and complex that they are difficult to manage with traditional software or hardware, or traditional data management tools. The platform transforms patients’ records into digital storage, could store other types of data, such as patient genomic, and clinical trial data. In addition, the platform could enable other advanced techniques, such as machine learning and graph analytics, to deliver more accurate predictive models that researchers could use to detect change in all kind of diseases symptoms.
